### Initializing project

To initialize project please run script initialize_repo.sh

```sh
$ ./initialize_repo.sh
``` 

Script intializes project with 3rd party libraries:
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)
[OCMockito](https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito)
[OCHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/OCHamcrest)

All above libaries are added using git submodules, OCMockito and OCHamcrest are also build to behave like a "framework".
